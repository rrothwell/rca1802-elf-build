# Firmware for COSMAC ELF

## Forth
### Survey

1. [Elf-RcForth](https://github.com/wd5gnr/Elf-RcForth/releases/tag/0.55rc1) is a native forth, but generating the binary will require a cross-assembler. There are some YouTube videos, but its a bit muddled. Authored by [Mike Riley](https://github.com/rileym65), extended by [wd5gnr](https://github.com/wd5gnr).
1. In the [1802 Membersip Card. Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/190289-1802-memberchip-card) artcle there is a forth and other software included in the diskless ElfOS. There is a binary of ElfOS for 32k ROM ([ElfOSv172.hex](https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/1902898141324576/ElfOSv172.hex)), that looks promising.
